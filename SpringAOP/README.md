[**Understanding Spring AOP**](https://javabrains.io/courses/spring_aop)

This course introduces the concepts of Aspect Oriented Programming and Spring AOP. You will learn to write Aspects in Java using Spring AOP and also understand the terminologies used in AOP along the way.

This course covers:

- Understanding Aspect Oriented Programming
- Writing an Aspect in Java
- Implementing Pointcuts and JoinPoints
- Understanding and writing different types of Advice
- Understanding AOP Proxies

**UNIT**

# 1

#### Getting Started

This unit covers an introduction to aspect oriented Programming. You&#39;ll learn why and where aspect oriented programming is helpful. You&#39;ll also setup an environment and a starter application to write Spring AOP code.

### 1.1 Introduction to AOP

This video provides a brief introduction to Aspect Oriented Programming concepts.

### 1.2 Setting Up AOP Dependencies

In this tutorial, we&#39;ll add the additional dependencies required for Spring AOP and we&#39;ll configure our project&#39;s class path with these dependencies.

# 2

#### AOP Annotations

Learn about Spring AOP&#39;s annotation support. Understand the various AOP concepts like Aspects, pointcuts and join points. Then implement them using Spring AOP annotations.

### 2.1 Writing Our First Aspect Part 1

In this first part of the tutorial, we&#39;ll create a Spring project that forms the basis for our Aspect. This is a good refresher of some of the core Spring concepts, and it also give us an opportunity to introduce a service layer in our code that we&#39;ll build on in the subsequent tutorials.

### 2.2 Writing Our First Aspect Part 2

Now that we have a basic Spring application, we&#39;ll implement the Logging aspect. We&#39;ll learn how to create a new Aspect using annotations and configure an advice to run before a getter method.

### 2.3 Pointcuts and Wildcard Expressions

We&#39;ll now learn what a Pointcut is, the Pointcut annotation and how to apply advice to multiple pointcuts.

### 2.4 A Few More Pointcut Expressions

In this tutorial, we&#39;ll learn about a few other Pointcut expressions that can be used to advice different methods.

### 2.5 JoinPoints and Advice Arguments

We&#39;ll now learn about join points, and how we can use arguments in the advice methods to get information about join points.

### 2.6 After Advice Types

We&#39;ll learn about the After Advice types: `After` (finally), `AfterReturning` and `AfterThrowing`.

### 2.7 Around Advice Type

This tutorial covers the Around advice type. We&#39;ll learn how to use it, and we&#39;ll also look at some of the unique and powerful features that are specific to this advice type.

### 2.8 Naming Conventions and Custom Advice Annotations

In this video, I share some thoughts on naming conventions, and how it helps in the case of writing aspects in Spring. We will also understand how to write our own custom annotations to apply advice to methods.

**UNIT**

# 3

#### Wrapping Up

Implement Spring AOP using XML. Also understand how the machinery behind aspects work in a Spring AOP application, by writing our own mini-implementation of aspects.

### 3.1 AOP XML configuration

We&#39;ll learn how to configure aspects, advice and pointcuts using the traditional XML way.

### 3.2 Understanding AOP Proxies

In this video, we go where no Spring AOP tutorial has gone before! We&#39;ll understand how Spring AOP works and how it uses proxy classes to apply advice. And we&#39;ll do this by implementing our own simple factory service. The way Spring AOP works is much more complicated, but this simple implementation should give us a solid understanding of proxy objects and clarify the core concepts
